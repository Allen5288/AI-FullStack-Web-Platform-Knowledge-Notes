## 1. comparing when to use FastAPI, Django, and Flask

| Criteria | FastAPI | Django | Flask |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary Use Case** | üöÄ High-performance APIs and microservices. | monolithic, full-stack web applications. | üõ†Ô∏è Small to medium apps, prototypes, and projects where you want full control. |
| **Philosophy** | Modern framework for building APIs with Python type hints. | "Batteries-included" framework. Provides everything out of the box. | Minimalist micro-framework. Unopinionated and highly extensible. |
| **Async Support** | ‚úÖ Native and built-in from the ground up. Ideal for async. | ‚è≥ Supported, but not as seamlessly as FastAPI. Many parts are still synchronous. | üß© Supported since version 2.0, but not its core design. |
| **Performance** | Excellent. One of the fastest Python frameworks. | Good. Slower for raw requests but performant enough for most full-stack apps. | Very good. Faster than Django, but performance depends on extensions. |
| **Key Features** | Automatic data validation, serialization, and interactive API docs (Swagger UI). | Built-in ORM, admin panel, authentication, and templating engine. | Core routing system and a development server. You choose all other tools. |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy, especially if you know Python type hints. | Steeper. You need to learn the "Django way" of doing things. | Very easy to get started with a simple app. |

**When to Choose...**

- **Choose FastAPI if:**
  - You are building a **REST API** as your primary product.
  - You need the **highest possible performance**, especially for I/O-bound operations.
  - You want automatic **data validation and API documentation**.
  - You are building **asynchronous** services from the start.
- **Choose Django if:**
  - You are building a large, **traditional web application** with a database, like an e-commerce site, a blog, or a CMS.
  - You want an **all-in-one solution** with a powerful admin panel, ORM, and authentication system out of the box.
  - **Rapid development** of a full-stack product is your top priority.
- **Choose Flask if:**
  - You are building a **smaller application** or a **prototype**.
  - You want a **lightweight and flexible** framework.
  - You want to **choose your own libraries** and tools (like which database library to use) and have full control over the components.
