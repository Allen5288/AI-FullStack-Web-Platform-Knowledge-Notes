## ## Architectural Design & Code Structure

Your code's structure is the foundation for a maintainable and scalable application. The goal is to **separate your core business logic from infrastructure-specific code** (like the Lambda handler or database clients).

- **Layered Architecture:** Adopt a layered approach like Clean or Hexagonal Architecture.
  - **Handler Layer (`handler.ts`):** This should only be an **adapter**. Its job is to parse the incoming request, call the service layer, and format the HTTP response. Keep it thin and free of business logic.
  - **Service Layer (`service.ts`):** This is where your **core business logic** lives. It orchestrates operations, performs complex validations, and coordinates with the data layer.
  - **Domain Layer (`model.ts`):** Defines your core data structures, types, and entities.
  - **Repository/Infrastructure Layer (`repository.ts`):** Handles all communication with external services like databases (e.g., DynamoDB) or third-party APIs. This abstracts the data source from your business logic.
- **Strong Typing:** Use **TypeScript** and enable `strict` mode in your `tsconfig.json`. This catches errors early, improves code quality, and makes collaboration on large projects much easier.

## ## Security Best Practices üîí

Security is not an afterthought; it must be designed into your application from the start.

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust identity controls. Use services like **Amazon Cognito** or implement **API Gateway Custom Authorizers** with JWTs to verify who is making a request and what they are allowed to do.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Always grant your Lambda functions the **minimum IAM permissions** they need to perform their tasks. If a function only needs to read from a DynamoDB table, don't give it write permissions.
- **Secrets Management:** **Never hardcode secrets** (API keys, database credentials) in your code or environment variables. Use a dedicated service like **AWS Secrets Manager** or **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** to securely store and retrieve them at runtime.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Treat all incoming data as untrusted.
  - Use **API Gateway schema validation** as a first line of defense.
  - Use a middleware library like **Middy.js** with a validator to check the request body inside the Lambda.
  - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## ## Observability & Monitoring üî≠

In a distributed serverless system, you can't debug by looking at a single log file. You need comprehensive observability.

- **Structured Logging:** Log in **JSON format**. This makes your logs searchable and easy to analyze in services like Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights. Include contextual information in every log entry.
- **Correlation IDs:** Pass a unique request ID (like the `X-Amzn-Trace-Id`) through all your functions and service calls. This allows you to trace a single user request across multiple distributed logs.
- **Custom Metrics:** Don't just monitor CPU and memory. Emit **custom business metrics** to Amazon CloudWatch (e.g., `orders_placed`, `payment_failures`). This helps you monitor the health of your business, not just your infrastructure.

## ## Error Handling & Resilience üõ°Ô∏è

Your application will encounter errors. A resilient architecture anticipates and gracefully handles them.

- **Centralized Error Handling:** Use a **global error handler middleware** (e.g., with Middy.js) to catch all uncaught exceptions. This ensures you always return consistent, well-formatted error responses to the client.
- **Custom Error Types:** Create specific error classes (e.g., `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`) that include HTTP status codes. This allows your centralized handler to set the correct response status automatically.
- **Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs):** For asynchronous processes (e.g., functions triggered by SQS or EventBridge), configure a DLQ. This captures any event that fails processing after several retries, so you can analyze and reprocess it later without losing data.
- **Retries & Circuit Breakers:** Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures when calling external services. For critical dependencies, consider using a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures.

## ## Configuration & Environment Management ‚öôÔ∏è

Your application needs to behave differently across environments like development, staging, and production.

- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables extensively for non-sensitive configuration that varies by stage (e.g., table names, third-party API URLs).
- **Parameter Store / Secrets Manager:** Use these AWS services for dynamic or sensitive configuration that you want to manage outside of your code deployment lifecycle.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Variables:** Use variables within your `serverless.yml` or Terraform files to dynamically configure resources (e.g., memory size, IAM roles) for each environment.

## ## Comprehensive Testing Strategy ‚úÖ

You can't have confidence in your application without a robust testing strategy.

- **Unit Tests:** Test your individual business logic functions (e.g., in your service layer) in isolation. These are fast and should form the bulk of your tests.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the integration points between your components, such as a service layer function correctly calling its repository. This often involves mocking AWS services.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Test the entire system flow from the public API endpoint to the database. These are slower but invaluable for catching issues in the complete request/response lifecycle.

## ## CI/CD & Automated Deployments üöÄ

Manual deployments (`sls deploy`) are fine for development but not for production.

- **Automated Pipeline:** Implement a full CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline) that automatically runs your tests on every commit.
- **Secure Deployments:** The pipeline should manage deploying your application to different environments (dev, staging, prod) in a secure and repeatable way.
- **Advanced Deployment Strategies:** For production, use strategies like **canary releases** or **blue/green deployments** to roll out new versions with zero downtime and the ability to quickly roll back if issues are detected.
